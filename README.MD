# reworked an old prime assignment
## made a fruit trading game prices randomly fluctuate and the 
## user can buy and sell to maximize profit

Took the old assignment reworked it added bootstrap sass gulp and tried to make the 
program more object oriented


To do: 
1. on completion a game over div is appended. it also shows game stats. The final money
and profit aren't working.
2. I want to make a randomizer for the interval timer.
